### Hi there 👋, my name is Amirali Farzaneh
#### I'm a junior Systems Engineer with a strong background in C/C++, MATLAB, Signal Processing, and Quality Assurance.
I have developed a keen interest in embedded systems, computer vision, and robotics.
Currently, I am working on a 6-axis robotic arm that will grab and hand-in a tool based on vocal commands. I am in stages of...
  -  Developing a mechanical prototype through 3D printing the designed arm
     -  Optimizing designs in Fusion 360 for development of kinematics algorithms.
  -  Embedded electronics
     -  Position feedbacks from servo motors.
  -  Developing an inverse kinematics algorithm

Skills: C/C++ / MATLAB / Python / VHDL  

- 🌱 Currently learning Rust, YOLOv3 Object-detection in Python, and Embedded C using MSP430
- 👨‍🔧 Aspiring P.Eng, registered as an Engineer-In-Training
